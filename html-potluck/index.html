        How To Make The Best Fried Chicken 
    </h3>

    <h4>
        Step 1
    </h4>
<p> 
     Whisk together the eggs, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce in a 
    medium-sized bowl. <br> Add the flour, cornstarch, and all of the seasonings 
    to a paper bag and shake to mix everything together. Dip each piece of 
    chicken into the egg coating turning to get both sides. Dip the coated 
    chicken into the seasoned flour thoroughly covering each piece.
</p>

    
    <h4>
        Step 2
    </h4>

    <p> 
        Add each piece of bread chicken to a baking sheet after its breaded. 
        Finish coating all the chicken and let it sit for 10-15 minutes until
        the coating has set.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Step 3
    </h4>

    <p>
        Heat 1-1/2 inches of oil in a cast iron skillet or heavy-bottom skillet
        over medium-high heat. Fry the chicken, four pieces at a time, on each 
        side starting with dark meat since it takes longer do not overcrowd the 
        pan. After each side has turned slightly golden, cover with the lid to 
        steam the inside of the chicken ensuring doneness. After a couple of 
        minutes remove the lid and continue to fry until the crust is crispy 
        and golden brown.Remove the chicken from the oil and place it on paper 
        towels or a wire rack to drain all the excess oil. Place the chicken 
        on a baking sheet covered with parchment and add it to the oven to 
        keep warm while finishing the other chicken pieces.

                1 (16 ounce) package cavatappi (corkscrew macaroni) <br> 
                6 tablespoons butter <br> ½ cup all-purpose flour <br>

                1 tablespoon truffle oil
            </p>

            <h3>
                Directions
            </h3>

            <h4>
                Step 1
            </h4>

            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
                 9x13-inch baking dish.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Step 2
            </h4>

            <p>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 
                cavatappi in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
                until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Then Drain.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Step 3
            </h4>

            <p>
                While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large pot over 
                medium-low heat. Whisk flour into melted butter until mixture 
                has a thick, paste-like consistency, about 30 seconds. Slowly
                whisk in 2 cups milk until smooth. Stir in remaining milk, 
                increase the heat to medium-high, and cook, whisking constantly, 
                until thick and almost boiling, 5 to 10 minutes.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Step 4
            </h4>

            <p>
                Add Gouda, Cheddar, Swiss, and 1 cup Parmesan; stir until 
                cheeses melt and sauce is smooth. Fold in cooked 
                cavatappi until coated. Pour mixture into the prepared
                 baking dish. 
            </p>

            <h4>
                Step 5
            </h4>

            <P>
                Stir remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs together 
                in a small bowl; sprinkle over cavatappi mixture, then drizzle 
                truffle oil over top.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Step 6
            </h4>

            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and topping
                 is golden about 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
