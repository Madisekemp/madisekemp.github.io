                        Marketing is typically conducted by the seller,
                        typically a retailer or manufacturer. Products can be
                        marketed to other businesses (B2B) or directly to
                        consumers (B2C).[5] Sometimes tasks are contracted to
                        dedicated marketing firms, like a media, market
                        research, or advertising agency. Sometimes, a trade
                        association or government agency (such as the
                        Agricultural Marketing Service) advertises on
                        behalf of an entire industry or locality, often
                        a specific type of food (e.g. Got Milk?), food
                        from a specific area, or a city or region as a
                        tourism destination.

                        Market orientations are philosophies concerning the
                        factors that should go into market planning.[6] The
                        marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the
                        product and how it will be sold, including the channels
                        that will be used to advertise the product,[7][8] is
                        affected by the environment surrounding the product,[9]
                        the results of marketing research and market research,
                        [10][11] and the characteristics of the product's target
                        market.[12] Once these factors are determined, marketers
                        must then decide what methods of promoting the product,
                        [5] including use of coupons and other price 
                        inducements.

                    <h3> Definition</h3>
        
                    <p>
                        Marketing is currently defined by the American Marketing
                        Association (AMA) as "the activity, set of institutions,
                        and processes for creating, communicating, delivering,
                        and exchanging offerings that have value for customers,
                        clients, partners, and society at large".[14] However,
                        the definition of marketing has evolved over the years.
                        The AMA reviews this definition and its definition for
                        "marketing research" every three years.[14] The
                        interests of "society at large" were added into the
                        definition in 2008.[15] The development of the
                        definition may be seen by comparing the 2008 definition
                        with the AMA's 1935 version: "Marketing is the
                        performance of business activities that direct the flow 
                        of goods, and services from producers to consumers".
                        The newer definition highlights the increased prominence
                        of other stakeholders in the new conception of 
                        marketing.
